<div style="text-align: justify"> According to WHO, stroke is second leading to death globally. Someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 minutes and dies of a stroke every 4 minutes. Thus, I wanted to predict stroke patients using 12 health factors and to identify factors that have the most influence to cause stroke on patients. The best model could be used by hospital staffs and healthcare professionals to indicate patients who are likely to have stroke and reduce the risk of sending them home. 
<br>
I performed exploratory data analysis, and different data mining methods including logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest to the dataset to find the best prediction model. I concluded that the best model is the Random Forest model with an accuracy of 99.5%. 
<br>
Models: Backward selection, Regression Tree, Random Forest.

<div style="text-align: justify"> We worked in a team of four members to analyze social good datasets of NYC Public schools. The purpose of this project is to  provide key findings that can enable effective investments in NYC schools, especially with those under-performing schools.
<br> 
We cleaned and wrangled a dataset comprised of seven small data files using Python and Tableau. 
<br>
Some interesting findings: <br>
• Student Performance is strongly associated with Economic Need Index <br>
• Those under-performing schools often have strong correlation with Teacher Performance, School Environment, and Family Relationship
