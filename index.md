<div style="text-align: justify"> According to WHO, stroke is second leading to death globally. Someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 minutes and dies of a stroke every 4 minutes. Thus, I wanted to predict stroke patients using 12 health factors and to identify factors that have the most influence to cause stroke on patients. The best model could be used by hospital staffs and healthcare professionals to indicate patients who are likely to have stroke and reduce the risk of sending them home. 
<br>
I performed exploratory data analysis, and different data mining methods including logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest to the dataset to find the best prediction model. I concluded that the best model is the Random Forest model with an accuracy of 99.5%. 
<br>
Models: Backward selection, Regression Tree, Random Forest.

<div style="text-align: justify"> This project will help us better understand the overall landscape of tax-exempt organizations in the Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes region. The resulting database can be used as a directory to search for organizations of specific sizes, in specific locations, and with specific mission focuses, for example.<br>
We also want to assess the financial situations of these organizations regarding profitability(income) and revenue. Financial health may disclose the quality of management and the preferences of American donors.
<br> 
We cleaned and wrangled a data set with 640k+ rows from IRS into a star schema relational database using PostgreSQL and Linux shell commands. 
<br>
Some interesting findings: <br>
• The most popular activities for non-profits are Religion and Education, while the least popular is Advocacy (Weapon system, Racial integration); <br>
• Geisinger Health Plan and Chancellor Masters & Scholars of the University of Oxford are the two not-for-profits that had the highest revenue in 2018; <br>
• February and March are the two months with the highest number of organizations that first received exempt status

[**Market-entry Case for Gyrfalcon Ventures - Precision Analytics in Agriculture**](https://github.com/jennifernguyen281/Market-Entry-Case-for-GV)

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Our client, Gyrfalcon Ventures, wants to exploit their recently-received ownership for international rights to GAAP, a platform of cutting-edge, market-leading precision agricultural analytics technologies that can be integrated into “quad-copter” drones. However, they are not sure which market to enter, while the value of GAAP is believed to diminish rapidly due to the client’s lack of incentive to invest heavily in R&D and actively innovating competitors. <br>
We recommended that GV should enter Australia and a course of next steps to make the most out of this opportunity in a 3-year time window. To answer the question, we analyzed 15 metrics from World Bank and other reputable sources to rank 50 countries. Some of the notable metrics are Area of Average individual farm size, GPD per capita PPP, and strictness of drone regulation.
